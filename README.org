#100DaysOfSwiftUI - Challenge 1 - Day 19 - [[www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19]]

** Day 19
You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.

Which units you choose are down to you, but you could choose one of these:

Temperature conversion: users choose Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
Length conversion: users choose meters, kilometers, feet, yards, or miles.
Time conversion: users choose seconds, minutes, hours, or days.
Volume conversion: users choose milliliters, liters, cups, pints, or gallons.
If you were going for length conversion you might have:

A segmented control for meters, kilometers, feet, yard, or miles, for the input unit.
A second segmented control for meters, kilometers, feet, yard, or miles, for the output unit.
A text field where users enter a number.
A text view showing the result of the conversion.
So, if you chose meters for source unit and feet for output unit, then entered 10, youâ€™d see 32.81 as the output.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
struct Title: ViewModifier {
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .font(.largeTitle)
            .foregroundColor(.blue)    }
}

extension View {
    func titleStyle() -> some View {
        return self.modifier(Title())
    }
}
